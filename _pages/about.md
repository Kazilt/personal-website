Hey!

I'm Anish, I am a student in Georgia Institute of Technology graduating December 2024, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. With a strong academic foundation, including coursework in Data Structures, Machine Learning, and Systems and Network, and industry experience via multiple internships I have developed expertise in software engineering and cloud computing. Some of the languages I'm comfortable programming in include Python, Java, and Typescript.

I've also been heavily involved with [GITMAD](https://gitmad.org) (Georgia Tech's Mobile Application Development Club) leading the club as president for the last 2.5 years.

In my free time I love playing sports and working out. Connect with me on LinkedIn!
