Hey, I’m Anish!

I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, set to graduate in December 2024. My journey has been fueled by a passion for innovation, with a strong academic focus on areas like Data Structures, Machine Learning, and Systems and Networks. Through hands-on industry experience, including internships, I’ve honed my skills in software engineering and cloud computing, with proficiency in Python, Java, and TypeScript.

Beyond the classroom, I lead [GITMAD](https://gitmad.org), Georgia Tech's Mobile Application Development Club, leading the club as President. For the past 2.5 years, I’ve had the privilege of shaping and driving the club’s direction, mentoring members, and fostering a community passionate about mobile development.

I’m actively seeking new software development opportunities where I can apply my expertise, learn, and contribute to exciting projects.

When I’m not coding or problem-solving, you can find me playing various sports or at the gym.
